  The Office of Sustainability has also worked with students on campus to provide programming to make sustainable actions a part of
  daily student life. Their most well-known initiative is the Green Terp program.
  <br><br>

  <br><br>
  The Green Terp program has University of Maryland students complete a pledge to practice sustainable actions in each of the
  following categories: recycling, water conservation, energy conservation, transportation, consumption, and cleaning and personal care.
  <br><br>
  In the 2018-2019 school year, 1,075 students took the Green Terp pledge in which they chose their most common sustainable actions by category.
<br><br>

  <div id="sectionhead"> How green are our Terps? </div>
<br>
<div id="explain">Participants of the Green Terp program must complete a pledge to join,
  then certify after completing sustainable actions. The 1,075 students that certified identified
  which actions they took over the course of the academic year. They were required to choose
  one action from each category and 10 overall. Here is the breakdown of the total actions by category.</div>

<div id="explain">On top of the Green Terp programming, the Resident Hall Association is working on implementing a GreenEdu training, mandatory for first-year residents. The program is modeled after AlcoholEdu, an online training residents must take to review responsible drinking habits.
<br><br>
By providing these types of programming to new Terps, the culture around sustainable living will be more normalized and expected, resulting in a lower environmental impact of the university.
