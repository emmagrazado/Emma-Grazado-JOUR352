  <div id="headline">With sustainability on the rise, how does the University of Maryland prioritize limiting its environmental impact?</div>
<br>
<div id="explain">At first glance, the University of Maryland is an exemplary institution in fighting climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s been awarded a Gold ranking for it’s sustainable practices by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education.
  It’s ranked in the top 40 “Cool Schools” by Sierra Magazine, for performance in sustainable action, and second among the Big 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Students, however, often ask themselves: is our school really doing enough to preserve our future on this planet?
  For many student activists, the answer is no. In fact, groups for climate action are getting together to demand more intensive climate action.

What’s the SCoop?</div>
<br><br>
<div id="explain">Student groups have recently formed the Sustainability Cooperative, nicknamed the SCoop, with the hopes of pushing the university towards more widespread and impactful climate action.
<br><br>
  <center>The SCoop is founded on three demands.</center>
  <br>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
    <div id="byline2"> Create a general education requirement in sustainability for undergraduate students</div>
        </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
    <div id="byline2">Divest from fossil fuels and transition from natural gas to renewable energy in a reasonable time frame
      </div>
      </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
    <div id="byline2">Transition to renewables or going Fossil Free in the next several decades</div>
      </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  <br>
  While these demands may seem out of reach, student activists have plans for how they can be implemented. Here is what they said.

The university diverts more than 80% of the waste it produces by way of composting, recycling, or repurposing.

<br>
10,000 solar panels produce over 3 megawatts of energy for the campus.
<br><br>
But one initiative in particular isn’t up to par with student activists in the SCoop: carbon neutrality.

The Climate Action Plan (CAP) by the Office of Sustainability projects the following achievements, based on the 2005 baseline:
<ul>
<li>50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020</li>
<li>60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025</li>
<li>Carbon neutral by 2050</li>
</ul>

<div id="explain">The SCoop believes it is the university’s responsibility to lead the world on a transition to carbon neutrality,
  given the critical situation.

  <br><br>
  “Many local areas do not have the resources available to figure out their transition, so we have an especially important obligation to create models that others can replicate,” said Michael Brennan, a public policy master’s student.
  <br><br>
  The University of Maryland chapter of MaryPIRG, a statewide, student directed and funded non-profit and non-partisan organization, is a strong advocate for this policy.
  MaryPIRG believes the university must push up it’s carbon offsetting goals so it can prioritize more effective energy systems from an earlier date.
  It hopes the university focuses more on being fossil free, by setting a goal like 2050 to get off offsets and use alternatives like biogas or geothermal energy.
  <br><br>
  “The divestment demand is also important because students have little accessibility to university investments,” said Sonja Neve, president of MaryPIRG and senior environmental science and policy major. “The first step is having more transparency so we know what our university is really investing in.”

<div id="explain">
“Sustainability affects all majors regardless of interest in it or not,” said Marie Panday, sustainability advisor and sophomore environmental science and policy major.
<br><br>
Studying sustainability, although popular, is currently voluntary. Many students feel it should be mandatory. The SCoop feels that students who don’t study sustainability miss out on important lessons that prepare them for the future of our environment.
<br><br>

“Today, we are faced with the option of either changing virtually every aspect of our society to be mindful of environment impact, or almost definitely face societal and economic collapse,” said Cole Garvin, sophomore architecture major and sustainability minor.<br><br>

“It is like investing in life insurance before entering a war zone, I guess.”</div>

Neve says she has taken many classes that could count towards this requirement: Introduction to Environmental Policy, Weather and Climate, and Sustainability.

    “The main problem we are hearing from the administration is that to create this gen-ed, there must be a certain number of seats open across all classes so that incoming freshman would be able to get into them,” Neve explained. “But, with existing lists of classes that function as
    sustainability electives it doesn't seem like it would be difficult to audit.”

 On top of the SCoop’s concerns, students feel there must more intent to include climate action into the university’s daily operations. When it failed to excuse absences for the Climate Strike, but cancelled
 classes for the Penn State football game a week later, Brennan felt the university’s priorities were not in the right place.
<br><br>
 “[The university] should publicly announce all student absences for the climate strikes are excused and no penalties are allowed, demonstrating [it] understands how urgent the climate crisis is,” Brennan said.
